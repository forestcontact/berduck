## The slightly-intelligent rubber duck that helps you think out loud

Berduck helps you "rubber duck" your problems. Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and int he process of talking you solve your problem or come up with new ideas. Berrduck helps with that process. You can chat with Berduck and it responds empathetically, with emoji faces and brainstorming questions to help you elaborate on your thoughts. 

It's not very smart, but that's okay: you are. Berduck records all your conversations in human-readable markdown files, so you can always access your previous thoughts.

Sometimes I give Berduck access to twitter. Follow [@b3rduck](https://twitter.com/berduck) and it will occasionally respond to your tweets.
